WP-OAuth
========

![logo](http://files.glassocean.net/github/wp-oauth-logo.png)

A WordPress plugin that allows users to login or register by authenticating with an existing Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Github, Reddit or Windows Live account via OAuth 2.0. Easily drops into new or existing sites, integrates with existing users.

WP-OAuth functions in a similar way to the StackExchange/StackOverflow login system which allows users to register or login with the least amount of steps required.
